[list]Hello my little ducklings,

It is with great sorrow that I write to let you all know that given the recent supply issue we will have to take corrective measure insofar as the cost of the goods offered, and the quality of goods offered, at our Service facilities for the foreseeable future. 

The following dictates how it applies to your specific workplace:

[list][*]Main Walkways, the Bar, the Kitchen, Medical, Security, Engineering, and Command are to be prioritized. Other areas are to be handled after if supplies permit;
